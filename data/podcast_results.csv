The Alien Adventures of Finn Caspian: Science Fiction for Kids,2WbFoPxB3Fk9JcdPkKGous,"The Alien Adventures of Finn Caspian is a serialized science-fiction story for kids (start with Episode 1), told in 15-20 minute episodes for parents to put on when driving around town, or to marathon on road trips, or to bond over before bed. The story centers on Finn Caspian, an 8-year-old boy aboard The Famous Marlowe 280 Interplanetary Exploratory Space Station. He and his friends Abigail, Elias and Vale are Explorers Troop 301, taking off from the Marlowe to explore uncharted planets, help the occasional alien, and solve a mystery that threatens to destroy the Marlowe.

The story is written and performed by Jonathan Messinger, author of Hiding Out, former web editor of Time Out Chicago Kids, and father of two boys. His son Griffin, 7, serves as editor of the story, appearing in episodes to critique, make predictions and express skepticism that his father knows what he's talking about, which also happens to be the way the rest of their relationship works.

Literature and History,2URS1nmmvvbXY7v7oDx23E,"With millions of downloads, hundreds of hours of soundtracked content, and an overall emphasis on the cultural history behind famous works of literature, Literature and History is one of the most popular independent podcasts on its subject. Starting with Sumerian cuneiform in 3,100 BCE, Literature and History moves forward in chronological order through Assyriology, Egyptology, the Old Testament, Ancient Greece and Rome, and the birth of Christianity. The show's current season is on Late Antiquity (or 200-700 CE) and the dawn of the Middle Ages.  A typical episode (they average about two hours) features a general introduction to a work of literature, then a full summary of that work that expects no prior knowledge, and finally, an analysis of the cultural, biographical, and historical forces that gave rise to the work in question. Original symphonic and ambient background music is woven throughout each show, and all episodes offer free full, illustrated, footnoted transcriptions as well as quizzes for purposes of review. The show has no advertisements, and its host takes pride in a professional approach that avoids chitchat and ephemera and gets straight to the educational content. You can listen to the episodes in any order, although most listeners begin at the beginning and proceed from there, as the podcast itself is chronologically organized.

Technology ,01eZBtHHb8LZKdHu2t5GYA,"1. High costs: Investing in new technologies can be expensive and may require upfront costs that your company might be unable to afford. 2. Lack of understanding: Not everyone understands the benefits of new technologies, and employees might be hesitant to use them or see the potential.  Inconsistent availability- Not all technologies are available in all locations or have consistent uptimes. This can be problematic for businesses that rely on these systems to conduct their operations. 3. Loss of control over personal data: As more and more companies rely on AI and machine learning for product recommendations, making recommendations for customers’ “next best actions,” and other functionalities, it is important to understand the risks of handing over personal data to these systems. Disclosing personal information to a third party may violate laws or breach contractual obligations and could put your company at risk for future lawsuits. This can put your company in a precarious position and leave you open to the risks associated with keeping that data in-house. 4. Exposure to malicious attacks: Cyber attacks will continue to rise in the future as hackers find new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in existing systems. Businesses have to be aware of the potential dangers of opening themselves up to these attacks and the possibility of significant financial loss. Cyber attacks have the potential to shut down power grids and other critical infrastructure, disrupt pharmaceutical supply chains, and cause significant damage to businesses that rely on internet-connected systems. This can be incredibly dangerous and costly to a company. 5. Violation of privacy and ethical standards: Many businesses are concerned about potential violations of privacy and ethical standards when considering AI and machine learning. These systems collect and analyze personal data, including information about customers and employees, and may be subject to governmental oversight and regulation. In some cases, using these technologies may require you to obtain consent from individuals whose data you are collecting, and it may be necessary to inform customers about how the data will be used. 6. Automation that leads to job loss: Many of the tasks that are currently being done by people are also being automated by robots and other technologies. This has caused some people to feel concerned that they will lose their jobs to robots and AI. This can cause a significant amount of anxiety and fear among the workforce, and, if it leads to people leaving the company, it can create an issue known as the “labor shortage. he fear of job loss is a legitimate concern, and businesses should be aware of the potential consequences of automation. However, there are ways to mitigate these risks and ensure that job loss is not a significant issue for your business. 7. Loss of personal contact and relationships: Although technology has made many aspects of our lives easier, it has also had a significant impact on the quality of relationships between people. Many people now rely on technology to communicate with loved ones. It is easy to forget that there is more to effective communication than sending a text or an email. There is a risk that people will become less empathetic and compassionate as they are unable to understand face-to-face experiences. 8. Technology dependence:  Technology is a powerful tool, and it can be used to benefit society greatly. However, many people are now dependent on technology, and it can be difficult for them to cope without it. It is possible that this dependence has a negative impact on health and well-being. It may even have an impact on productivity. It is therefore important that people do not become too reliant on technology. After all, it is possible that new devices will emerge that could render your gadgets obsolete. This could make it difficult for you to continue using them",Technology

"HER Style Podcast | Shopping, Color Palettes, Fashion, Wardrobe, Outfits, Clothing",4LUotJCqksjy42Jpz5gwlW,"The Go-To Podcast for Ambitious Women Who Want to Build Their Dream Wardrobe and Show Up with Confidence!  **TOP 10 FASHION & BEAUTY PODCAST**  Are you sick of having a closet full of clothes and nothing to wear? Have you been wearing and buying the same things on autopilot? Do you struggle to put your pieces together? Do you wish you could get dressed quickly in the morning and feel good as you go about your day?  I’m so glad you’re here! This podcast will give you a clear cut system to elevate your style and put together a capsule wardrobe that feels right for you so you can show up and get dressed every day with confidence!  Hey friend, I’m Heather Riggs, a wife, mom, and 17-year Certified Image Consultant and Color Specialist.  After having my son in 2018, my whole life changed. My clothing didn’t feel right for me anymore. I didn’t have the time or energy to figure it out, so I tried a lot of the quick-fix mistakes you might be making. I copied what the other “cool mom” influencers were wearing on Instagram. I defaulted to preset outfits and cookie-cutter capsule wardrobes that were tailored for someone else and not for me. I ended up feeling even more frustrated and confused about what to wear.  I realized that if I was going to feel confident and excited to get dressed again, I needed to buy less and shop smarter.  So I sat down and mapped out the exact steps I’d taken with my most successful personal styling clients over the years and decided to get to work. Following this simple system, I built my dream wardrobe easily, efficiently, and inexpensively and now I want to help you do the same!  In this podcast, I will teach you how to:  - Figure out and elevate your personal style - Embrace and dress the body you have now so you can stop wasting money on clothes that don’t look good on you - Add more color into your wardrobe with confidence - Get rid of things (without feeling guilty!) and organize your closet - Design a custom capsule wardrobe that reflects where you are in your life - Quit impulse shopping and chasing fashion trends and start finding exactly what you want and need to fill in the gaps - Make the best use of your pieces and style them in new and exciting ways  You don’t have to go out and buy an entire new wardrobe. You just need someone to show you the simple art and science of getting dressed! I’m here to provide you with the practical tools and customized support you need — all with a side order of humor and humility (because fashion isn’t meant to be taken too seriously!).  Get ready to binge hours of free style advice and enjoy getting dressed again!

The Royal family is finding its way in a new era. Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles III began his reign alongside Camilla, The Queen Consort. William and Kate became Prince and Princess of Wales. As the family changes, rifts remain with Harry and Meghan across the Atlantic and Prince Andrew is still in the aftermath of the Newsnight interview. There is joy too, as Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis grow up both in and out of the public eye, and the Tindalls, Beatrice and Eugenie find their own ways.  Expect behind the scenes details, fashion, travel, causes, politics and society, plus interviews with people who can provide a particular insight into your favourite Royals, their work and their place in Britain today. “Lively discussions with a wide-ranging appeal. Refreshingly informal, totally unstuffy and a thoroughly modern take on all things royal. And it’s funny too.” - the Press Awards Judges, who named Pod Save The King Lifestyle Podcast of the Year.

Raising Parents with Emily Oster,2Xl6ASfHB74Q6MUH4htklS,"Poseidon is the god of the sea, Dionysus of wine and merrymaking, and Emily Oster? She’s the god of parenting.   An economics professor at Brown University, Oster has built a massive and loyal audience by providing overwhelmed parents with the information and data they need to make solid and sound parenting decisions in a very confusing world. Her first book, Expecting Better: Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom Is Wrong—and What You Really Need to Know, sold over a million copies and was translated into 19 languages, unseating the classic What to Expect When You’re Expecting as a fixture on many pregnant mothers’ bedtime tables.   In this new series with The Free Press, Oster tackles the deep, difficult, existential, and often controversial questions facing parents today: Are we too soft on kids these days? How do I raise an independent child in an era of overprotection and helicopter parenting? Why are so many teen girls unhappy and anxious, and how can we make them happy again? Why are boys being left behind? Are kids overdiagnosed? What to do about the phones!? Is marriage important for raising kids? Should you even have kids at all?   These questions are more urgent than ever. That’s because, by many measures, kids are worse off today than 30 years ago. They are more anxious than ever. They’re more depressed. They have more diagnoses than ever before. They’re more medicated. More kids are being raised without two parents in the home today. Kids’ reading and math scores haven’t recovered since their decline during the Covid pandemic. Childhood obesity has risen to 19.7 percent. Kids spend on average 7.5 hours in front of a screen for entertainment each day, and the average teen spends around 9 hours a day on their phone.  What’s going on with kids today? How worried should we be about our kids? And what should we be doing, as parents, to change course, before it’s too late? How do we raise good people—which starts with raising good, informed parents—in this strange, new world?   Over eight episodes, Oster speaks with over 50 of the world’s best parenting experts, journalists, doctors, psychologists, researchers, and more including: Dr. Becky, Jonathan Haidt, Pamela Druckerman, Richard Reeves, Hanna Rosin, Abigail Shrier, Bryan Caplan, Christine Emba, Johann Hari, Sami Timimi, Melissa Kearney, Ross Douthat, and many, many more. Oster brings her trusted voice—with its sobriety, wisdom, and humor—to the most challenging parenting questions of the day.   The best way to support this podcast is to become a Free Press subscriber today at TheFP.com/subscribe",Parenting

I get it, you’re done being left on read, getting ghosted and being caught up in a cycle of attracting emotionally unavailable men. Let’s be real - you have NEEDS. You deserve it all, you deserve to feel worthy and confident. You deserve a fulfilling love life.  For years I was going through the same experiences with men over and over again that left me feeling confused, anxious, and pissed off. I silenced myself in dating and relationships because I was terrified of being judged, rejected, and abandoned. I just wanted a meaningful relationship and thought I was doing all the right things. But none of it was working.  I knew I couldn’t continue to repeat the same cycle with different men.   Something had to change.   I decided in that moment that I was going to finally work on healing my own wounds and work on myself, so that I could experience a beautiful and fulfilling relationship. I decided to put myself first.   And now, with this podcast, I want to share with you the exact internal work strategies that I did to get to a place of confidence, peace, and worthiness.   You can kiss ALL of your worries and limiting beliefs around love goodbye. Are you ready? Grab your favorite glass of wine and let’s get to work, because it is time to reclaim your self worth babe.
